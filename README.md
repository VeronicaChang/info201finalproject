# Overview
## Purpose
The purpose of our project is to help people track the correlation between their side effects and the drugs they are prescribed to.
## Audience
Our target audience is people who are taking prescribed medications for a long period of time, for example, 6+ months. We want our users to learn from this project is to help them be more proactive about their health.
## Data
[The SIDER Side Effect Resource](http://sideeffects.embl.de/download/) was created by a group of scientists who decided to collect public information of side effects for drug target prediction. The link is to a report he wrote about the unwanted side effects of drugs. This is partly the inspiration for this project, in that we are helping users keep track of possible side effects so they are actively aware and can act to account for these effects.

[The Drug.com Database](https://www.drugs.com/sfx/) provides independent information over 24,000 prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicine, and natural products. This material is provided for educational purposes only and is not intended for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

## Visualizations
For our first plot, when the user gives an input of a drug name, it filters and returns the side effects associated with the given drug.
Our second plot tracks the inverse; when the user gives us side effects they are experiencing, we return the drugs which are associated with said side effects.
Finally, we depict a map of health clinics in Seattle for users to refer to in case they wish to seek further medical assistance.
