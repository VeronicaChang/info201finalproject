## Purpose
The issue we are focusing on for our project is helping people track the possible side effects to their prescribed drugs. Our target audience is people who are taking prescribed medications for a long period of time, for example, 6+ months. We want our users to learn from this project is to help them be more proactive about their health. Having a mood journal is a proven way to help identify early warning signs of potential side effects. Finally, we keep track of possible triggers that could bring on symptoms and try to avoid it. For example, a high-stress event like a school test could trigger a side effect of a medication. This will be helpful for their doctor/ therapist and themselves in trying to find solutions to these situations. Mood diaries have also been beneficial in helping patients cope with the different moods that they experience. Thus, our application will help them keep track of their moods and symptoms in conjunction with a database of possible side effects associated.

## Data Sources
[The SIDER Side Effect Resource](http://sideeffects.embl.de/download/) was created by a group of scientists who decided to collect public information of side effects for drug target prediction. Citing: Kuhn M, Letunic I, Jensen LJ, Bork P. The SIDER database of drugs and side effects. The link is to a report he wrote about the unwanted side effects of drugs. This is partly the inspiration for this project, in that we are helping users keep track of possible side effects so they are actively aware and can act to account for these effects.

[The Drug.com Database](https://www.drugs.com/sfx/) provides independent information over 24,000 prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicine, and natural products. This material is provided for educational purposes only and is not intended for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. Citing: Cerner Multum and Wolters Kluwer.

## Deliverable
Our final product is a shiny application that allows users to easily journal their emotions and then creates informative visuals to the user.
